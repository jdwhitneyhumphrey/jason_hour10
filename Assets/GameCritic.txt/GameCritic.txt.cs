Enchancement 2: Seems a bit short as there's just four goals, maybe add more to keep the player engaged longer. Enhancement 3: There's not really any hazards of any kind or obstacles to navigate, consider adding those to add a challenge. Enhancement 4: The Chaos balls and colored balls are difficult to get to due to their speed, consider slowing them down a bit whenever possible.");
